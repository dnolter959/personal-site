    "text": "When I admire people, they normally do these things.\nTell the truth: They say things that are true, quantifying uncertainty as appropriate. They don’t say things that are false. They follow these rules relentlessly, and especially when delivering news people don’t want to hear.\nUse their words: They initiate difficult conversations and don’t allow important things to go unsaid, especially with those close to them.\nWrite: They use writing as a tool to clarify their thinking. (As an aside, I believe writing is highly underrated in the workplace. I endorse the Amazon approach to meetings.)\nBalance their lives: They understand that life is short and we get one chance at this. They design their lives appropriately.\nSeek new experiences: They resist status quo bias and they try new things to make their lives richer.\nEngage with the world: They actively participate in the communities where they live, and they recognize that their choices matter and they have the capacity to change the world."

    "text": "1. An R package for multiple imputation on longitudinal data\nIt turns out people don’t like completing surveys, especially longitudinal ones. What are you supposed to do with the half-data you are left with at the end? This R package implements a statistical method proposed by Moreno-Betancur and Chavance in their 2013 paper, which facilitates sensitivity analyses of Mixed Model results to various departures from the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption, in the presence of drop-out.\n\n\n2. A Python package for automatic differentiation\nHave you ever wanted to take a derivative, but with a computer? This Python package performs automatic differentiation of scalar or vector functions with scalar or vector inputs. The package can perform “forward” or “reverse” mode automatic differentiation.\n\n\n3. A Python data analysis on food access programs\nSome people do not have access to food they need to live healthy lives. The purpose of this analysis was to use publically available data sources to identify US counties which would be good targets for a government program to address poor food accesss. I sought to identify communities that would be well served by such a program, and also estimate the health impact of these programs.\n\n\n4. Understanding regularization in the presence of sparsity.\nRegularization is used within the context of linear regression to balance bias and variance and avoid overfitting. This paper details the results of a simulation study to investigate the performance of LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net approaches on model performance under a variety of conditions (e.g., high sparsity)."
