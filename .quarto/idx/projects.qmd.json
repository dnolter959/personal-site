What are you supposed to do with the half-data you are left with at the end? [This R package](https://github.com/dnolter959/longdrop2) implements a statistical method proposed by Moreno-Betancur and Chavance in their 2013 paper, which facilitates sensitivity analyses of Mixed Model results to various departures from the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption, in the presence of drop-out.\n\n\n### 2. A Python package for automatic differentiation\nHave you ever wanted to take a derivative, but with a computer? [This Python package](https://github.com/dnolter959/autodiff) performs automatic differentiation of scalar or vector functions with scalar or vector inputs. The package can perform \"forward\" or \"reverse\" mode automatic differentiation. \n\n### 3. A Python data analysis on food access programs\nSome people do not have access to food they need to live healthy lives. The purpose of [this analysis](https://github.com/dnolter959/food_access_programs) was to use publically available data sources to identify US counties which would be good targets for a government program to address poor food accesss. I sought to identify communities that would be well served by such a program, and also estimate the health impact of these programs.\n\n### 4. Understanding regularization in the presence of sparsity. \nRegularization is used within the context of linear regression to balance bias and variance and avoid overfitting. [This paper](content/regularization.pdf) details the results of a simulation study to investigate the performance of LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net approaches on model performance under a variety of conditions (e.g., high sparsity).","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n### 1.
